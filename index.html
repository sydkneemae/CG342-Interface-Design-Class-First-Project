            <h2>Kimberly Garneau</h2>
            <p> Kimberly Garneau is a pretty cool and interesting individual. She enjoys chai tea and Magic the Gathering. When she isn't spending hours sitting on the floor doing her Magic dailies, she can instead be found sitting on the floor and playing Fortnite. Though she has never achieved a Victory Royale, she is steadily on her way towards doing so. Kim is a big fan of vegetable california rolls from the dining hall, and roasts me for my carbon footprint being high enough to need two earths to be sustainable. She is an avid lover of Tipsy Shanghai and also her cat Greyson. </p><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/757650958095351809/1078774902041096202/IMG_9889.jpg" class="buttons-link" target="_blank">Click here to read more!</a></p>
            <h3>Tyler Hernandez</h3>
            <p>Tyler Hernandez is also a pretty cool and interesting individual. She enjoys Roblox and claiming she has deleted TikTok, but still somehow sending me TikToks through the app. She has immense beef with Blender, and becomes distraught at the prospect of not using Autodesk Maya to complete her 3D work. She is super organized and the best way to win her heart is to buy her some fancy pens and other stationary supplies so she can make her planners even prettier. She also loves caesar salads with added chopped apples from Just Salad. When I asked her for her favorite meme, she provided this.</p><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/954782309876371516/1078775919046565942/IMG_9511.png" class="buttons-alert" target="_blank">Click here to find out!</a>
