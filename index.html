            <p> Kimberly Garneau is a pretty cool and interesting individual. She enjoys chai tea and Magic the Gathering. When she isn't spending hours sitting on the floor doing her Magic dailies, she can instead be found sitting on the floor and playing Fortnite. She is an avid lover of Tipsy Shanghai and also her cat Greyson. </p><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/757650958095351809/1078774902041096202/IMG_9889.jpg" class="buttons-link" target="_blank">Click here to read more!</a></p>
            <h3>Tyler Hernandez</h3>
            <p>Tyler Hernandez is also a pretty cool and interesting individual. She enjoys Roblox and claiming she has deleted TikTok, but still somehow sending me TikToks through the app. She has immense beef with Blender, and becomes distraught at the prospect of not using Autodesk Maya to complete her 3D work.

She also loves caesar salads with added chopped apples from Just Salad. When I asked her for her favorite meme, she provided this.</p><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/954782309876371516/1078775919046565942/IMG_9511.png" class="buttons-alert" target="_blank">Click here to find out!</a>
